freetype on marmalade
====================

This module can be used to build the freetype library into marmalade
applications.

FreeType 2 is a software font engine that is designed to be small, efficient, highly customizable, and portable while capable of producing high-quality output (glyph images). It can be used in graphics libraries, display servers, font conversion tools, text image generation tools, and many other products as well.

Note that FreeType 2 is a font service and doesn't provide APIs to perform higher-level features like text layout or graphics processing (e.g., colored text rendering, ‘hollowing’, etc.). However, it greatly simplifies these tasks by providing a simple, easy to use, and uniform interface to access the content of font files.

FreeType 2 is released under two open-source licenses: our own BSD-like FreeType License and the GPL. It can thus be used by any kind of projects, be they proprietary or not.
